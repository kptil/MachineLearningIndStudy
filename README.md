# MachineLearningIndStudy

The repository contains notes and Jupyter Notebooks I produced during an independent study of machine learning. My primary resources were Christopher Bishop's Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning and the [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/index.html) by Jake VanderPlas. Some of the code in the notebooks is taken directly from the Python Data Science Handbook.
